# knowledgeevaluatorbot

IMPORTANT: You need to have a PyCharm working environment
Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and telebot libraries are used.
The ElasticNet machine learning algorithm is used.
(if pycharm itself does not open, then download the libraries - 
how to download:
1 go to the lib folder
2 download everything
3 write pip install <file name> in the knsol (it must be installed by pip via custom with a checkbox on pip) and (in the case of telebot - pyTelegramBotApi)
4 go to PyCharm and click on File in the upper left corner, then on Settings
5 in the window that pops up, we look for Project: project - click, then on Python Interpreter
6 there will be a plus sign in the left corner - click and type the library name into the search (in the case of a telebot, we need to drive in both telebot and pyTelegramBotApi just in case)
8 click install at the bottom under this button, a notification about the installation will appear upon completion)
